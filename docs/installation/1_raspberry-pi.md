:::warning
Historically, I recommended using Raspberry Pi for installing Gladys.

However, they are becoming less competitive for several reasons:

- A high overall cost once you add the power supply, case, and SSD.
- Limited reliability with a micro-SD card and a complex installation with an SSD.
- Even with a USB SSD, the performance is still far inferior to that of a mini-PC with an integrated NVMe SSD.
- A less powerful processor compared to low-power Intel equivalents.
- Recurring power issues when adding a Zigbee dongle and an SSD.

My recommendation is to buy a mini-PC. There are powerful options available on Amazon, including refurbished mini-PCs available for cheap.

To install Gladys Assistant on a Raspberry Pi, I recommend installing Raspberry Pi OS first, then use our [Docker](/docs/installation/docker) tutorial.
