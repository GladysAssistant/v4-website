### What is the philosophy of the project?

The goal of the project is to create a home automation software:

- **Privacy friendly**, the data is stored locally at the user's premises.
- **Easy to use**. User experience is our priority. Gladys has been developed with attention to detail, each feature has been thought through before being developed. It is not the technical constraints that define our product choices, it is our product requirement that forces us to find technical solutions.
- **Design**. Gladys Assistant's beautiful interface is the signature of the project, and we spend a lot of time making sure that stays that way.
- **Efficient**. Gladys must be able to take a certain load without compromising the fluidity of the interface.
- **Lightweight**. We want the software to have a minimal footprint on the user's system. We spend a lot of time analyzing the dependencies we use, in order to deliver a lightweight product.
- **Stable**. Gladys must remain stable over the long term. We want our users to use Gladys for years to come, with no downtime, with continuous updates and without a hitch.
- **Secure**: We put all the best practices in place so that Gladys is secure. We have automated processes in place to ensure that security regressions are not introduced in every version of Gladys.
