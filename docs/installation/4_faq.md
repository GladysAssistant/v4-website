- **Privacy friendly**, the data is stored locally at the user's premises.
- **Easy to use**. User experience is our core focus. Gladys has been developed with attention to detail; each feature has been thought through before being developed. It is not the technical constraints that define our product choices, it is our product requirement that forces us to find technical solutions.
- **Design**. Gladys Assistant's beautiful interface is the signature touch of the project. We spend a lot of time making sure that stays that way.
- **Efficient**. Gladys must be able to take a certain load without compromising the fluidity of the interface.
- **Lightweight**. We want the software to have a minimal footprint on the user's system. We spend a lot of time analyzing the dependencies we use, in order to deliver a lightweight product.
- **Stable**. Gladys must remain stable in the long term. We want our users to use Gladys for years to come, with no downtime, with continuous updates and without any glitches.
- **Secure**: We put all the best practices in place in order to ensure Gladys is secure. We have automated processes in place that make sure no security regressions are introduced in each new version of Gladys.
