Installing on a mini-PC is the recommended method to fully enjoy Gladys. These small computers are reliable, powerful, energy-efficient, and affordable, making them an excellent solution for a home setup.

## Which Hardware to Choose?

I recommend the Beelink Mini S12 Pro. It's an incredible machine, at an affordable price.

I've been using it for the past year, and I've had great performance, and no issues at all.

You can find it on [Amazon US](https://amzn.to/4gKDV2E) for $169.

## Installing Ubuntu Server on the Mini-PC

There are many videos online to install Ubuntu Server on a mini-PC.
