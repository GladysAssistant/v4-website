Some alarm clocks have the ability to turn on the light progressively to wake you up smoothly.
With Gladys, you can define a scene to fade your Hue bulb in.

## Fade in a light in a scene

If you want to fade in a light in a scene, you can add a “fade in” action to your scene and select the lights you want to fade in.
You can control the maximum intensity the light with reach and how long it will take to turn on.

If there is another action to be run sequentially after this fade-in action, it will be triggered when the light has reached the desired intensity.
