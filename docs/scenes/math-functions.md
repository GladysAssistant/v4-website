- `*` : multiplication
- `/` : division
- `%` : modulo
- `^` : power
- `abs(-5)` : absolute value (Result = 5)
- `round(5.2)` : rounding (Result = 5)
- `round(5.8, 1)` : rounding with 1 decimal place (Result = 5.8)
- `floor(5.2)` : floor rounding (Result = 5)
- `ceil(5.2)` : ceiling rounding (Result = 6)
- `random(1, 10)` : random number between 1 and 10
