It is common in home automation to want to program a scene: every day? Once a day ? once a week ? Once a month ? Every 15 minutes?

Gladys offers a trigger that allows you to program the execution of a scene.

There are 5 types of programming possible:

- Every month
- Every week
- Everyday
- At intervals
- On a specific day

Presentation of the different possibilities:

## Every month

This trigger allows you to schedule the execution of a scene, every month on a specific day of the month.

This is useful if, for example, you want to run a scene every 1st of the month.

## Every week

This trigger lets you schedule a scene to run on certain days of the week at a specific time.

It is probably the most used trigger, because it allows you to set up everything that is "daily routine".

If you want to wake up to a custom scene, every day of the week (Monday-Friday) at 7am, this is what it will look like:

## Everyday

This trigger allows you to trigger a scene every day at a specific time.

Useful for all recurring tasks that occur every day of the week.

## Interval

This trigger is special. It allows you to program a scene, not by "day" but at a particular interval (every 30 seconds, every 15 minutes, every hour).

Example:

![Scene scheduled at interval](../../static/img/docs/en/scenes/scheduled-trigger/scheduled-trigger-interval.jpg)

## On a specific date

This trigger allows you to schedule your scene on a specific day and at a specific time.

Example: June 4, 2020 at 2:00 p.m.
