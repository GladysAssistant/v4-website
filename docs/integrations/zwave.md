:::warning
December 2022: This Open-Zwave integration is now deprecated, and we are migrating to Zwave-js-ui, a new library written in pure JS, more robust, and with a wide range of compatible devices.

In the meantime, we highly recommend that you use Gladys + Node-RED + ZWaveJS2mqtt instead of this integration.

If you want to help us migrate to ZWaveJS, we are looking for maintainers, join us on the forum if you want to help.

## Connect your USB dongle to your Raspberry Pi

First, plug your Z-Wave dongle to your Raspberry Pi.

## Select in Gladys the USB port of your dongle

Then, go the `Integrations -> Z-Wave` tab in Gladys, and go to the `Settings` page.

Here, you can select the USB port of your Z-Wave dongle.

Gladys will now take a few minutes to scan your network.

## Add your Z-Wave in Gladys

Back to the `Configuration` tab, you can now add each devices to Gladys!
