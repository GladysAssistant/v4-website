## On the Gladys Side

To connect your Gladys instance to HomeKit, go to the `Integrations` menu and click on `HomeKit`.

You’ll find a QR code there that allows the Apple Home app to add Gladys as a HomeKit bridge.

## Home App

On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, open the **Home** app.

1. Tap the `+` icon at the top right, then select `Add Accessory`.
2. Scan the **QR code** displayed in the HomeKit integration page in Gladys.
3. The app will detect Gladys as a **HomeKit bridge** and automatically import all compatible devices.

During this initial setup, the app will ask you to assign each device to a room. You can either select an existing room or create a new one.

You can now **control your devices via the Home app or with Siri voice commands** 🗣️✨

## Supported Devices

Here is the list of currently supported devices:

- 💡 Light bulbs (On/Off, color, temperature, brightness)
- 🔌 Plugs (On/Off)
- 🌡️ Temperature sensors
- 💧 Humidity sensors
- 🚪 Door/window sensors
- 🪟 Roller shutters and curtains

We regularly add support for new device types based on community feedback. Feel free to suggest yours on the [Gladys forum](https://en-community.gladysassistant.com/)!

## Adding New Devices After Initial Pairing

If you add a new device in Gladys after you’ve already linked to HomeKit:

- If the device is **compatible**, it will be automatically added to HomeKit in a **default room**. You can then move it to the correct room manually.
- If the new device **doesn’t appear**, try restarting the HomeKit integration by clicking the `Restart` button, then wait a few seconds for the bridge to reload.
