It is possible to control Gladys devices with Alexa using [Gladys Plus](/plus), our online gateway service.

Alexa is a unique integration, because Alexa works exclusively in the cloud. This means we have very limited control over what we can and can't do (unfortunately).

To become a Alexa partner, we had to:

- Pass some automated unit tests on Amazon side
- Pass a manual review from Amazon team
- Complete a Alexa Certification process

This is not a simple process, and therefore it's not realistic for all our users go through it on their side. It is a process that is intended for professionals & companies, hence why we offer this integration in Gladys Plus, exclusively.

## Create a Gladys Plus account

To join Gladys plus, head over to the [dedicated page](/plus), and enter your email.

## Configure Gladys Plus

Gladys Plus needs to be fully configured before you can use the Google Home integration.

We recommended you follow the step you received by email to configure Gladys Plus.

At the end, you should be able to connect to [plus.gladysassistant.com](https://plus.gladysassistant.com) without any issue.

Once you have successfully logged in to Gladys plus, you can configure Google Home!

## Configure Alexa
