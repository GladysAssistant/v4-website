OpenAI definitely revolutionized the world of artificial intelligence when it launched ChatGPT last year.

What if you could use ChatGPT to control your connected home?

We wouldn't be far from having our very own Jarvis at home, just a quick message away!

## Prerequisites

As the OpenAI API is not free, this integration is part of Gladys Plus. Start by creating your account to get access to ChatGPT ðŸ™‚

## Configuration

It's very simple, just activate ChatGPT in the OpenAI ChatGPT integration in "Integrations":
