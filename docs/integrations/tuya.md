## FAQ

### Is the scan not working?

On the forum, Francis66 had this issue, and he resolved it this way:

- I no longer had access rights to the API resources
  - Access to Cloud Develop Base Resource and IoT Core was lost because the trial period had expired.
- For the region: I had selected Western Europe instead of Central Europe.

### Error: "Error: Unable to start service tuya TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'list' of 'result' as it is undefined."

If this error appears in your logs, please check the following:

- Internet connectivity of the device
  - Ensure that the system has proper DNS resolution and that internet access is not blocked by piHole or similar software.
- Double-check your credentials and verify that the correct data center is selected.
- Check the IoT Core package validity
> The IoT Core trial package is only active for one month and must be renewed manually.

Due to the fast-paced evolution of the Tuya Developer Platform, there is no single, permanent tutorial available for this process.  
Open the Details section in the Tuya Developer Console and follow the on-screen wizard to extend your trial period.  
After extending the trial, it may take up to 15 minutes before your hardware becomes accessible again.  
This process is **only** neccessary for connecting your account to Gladys for the **first time**
