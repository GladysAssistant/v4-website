[Owntracks](https://owntracks.org/) is an open-source mobile app which sends the phone location to a server, periodically.

Gladys Plus allows you to receive Owntracks message and create location in Gladys.

Select "HTTP", and in the "URL" input, enter:

```
https://api.gladysgateway.com/v1/api/owntracks/[YOUR-API-KEY]
```

In the `UserID` and `DeviceID` input, you can put anything you want (those fields are mandatory).

I put "iphone" for the `DeviceID`, and "pierre-gilles" for the `UserID`.

Gladys uses the API key to identify who is making the request.
