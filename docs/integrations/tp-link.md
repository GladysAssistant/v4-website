To connect your TP-Link lights and plugs, go to `Integrations / TP-Link` in Gladys.

## Scan devices on the network

By clicking on the button `Scan network`, Gladys will automatically detect different devices available on your Wi-Fi network. Be sure that they are installed, configured (with Kasa application) and turned on to be visible.
