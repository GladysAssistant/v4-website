In Gladys Assistant, you can display the average temperature of a room on your dashboard.

This box will look for the temperature of all the temperature sensors present in the room, and displays an average on the dashboard.

## Prerequisites

You must first have configured at least one temperature sensor. It could be a sensor from any protocol (Z-Wave, MQTT, whatever), and have assigned that sensor to a room.

## Configuration

Go to the dashboard, and click on "Edit".

Select the "room temperature" box, and click on the + button.

Then select the room you want to display.
