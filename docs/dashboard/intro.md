In Gladys Assistant, the dashboard is the main page of Gladys.

This page is fully configurable to meet your needs.

Display camera images? Monitor sensor values? Control his lights?

In this category of documentation, we'll walk through all types of "boxes" (or widgets if you like!), And explain how each one works.

If you have any needs that are not covered by the current Gladys dashboard, do not hesitate to contact us on [the forum](https://community.gladysassistant.com/) to see if we can develop a specific box.
