Hi everyone!

I've been wanting to tell you about this project for so long, so here it is at last üòÅ

For those who missed the launch, the replay is available on YouTube (in French):

## I'm buying an apartment

The first news of this launch is that I'm buying an apartment in the south of France: my first main residence!

Obviously, I'm going to connect this apartment entirely with Gladys and make it a real showcase for what's possible in home automation in 2024 üòé

I'm going to push the cursors to the max on all subjects: lighting, presence detection, security, music, etc....

The aim of this apartment is also to turn it into a real laboratory for home automation experiments.

This will allow me to be at the forefront in terms of Gladys use, and to be able to test all the new features at home.

## I'll show you my personal setup

For the moment, the apartment is empty.

I'm going to take advantage of this installation to film several episodes in the form of a mini-series where I'll present each part of my installation and explain how to do the same at home:

- Lighting
- Presence detection
- Music
- Connected office
- Sensors
- Connected kitchen
- Security & Safety
- Energy savings

And much more!

The training course is already available for pre-order and will officially start on **Friday February 9 at 8pm**.

### Quite an investment

For this installation, I invested in a wide variety of home automation equipment, and you'll see it's worth the detour!

- There's some nice lighting, with different price ranges tested
- Room-by-room presence management
- A connected desktop suitable for YouTube live streams (a welcome change from my current setup!)
- A master tablet to control the whole house
- And I'll say no more to avoid spoilers üòá

In terms of the quality of this series, it will be shot mainly with professional equipment:

- SLR camera (Canon EOS 80D)
- Tripod
- R√òDE microphone
- DJI stabilizer for moving shots

This series will be shot as the installation progresses, and with your feedback of course!

There will be calls with training members to help you replicate this setup at home at the same time.

## Impact on the project

As I said in the live, we're currently at 711 Gladys installations.

My goal now is to convince the next 10,000 people to join us.

To reach this goal, it's impossible to introduce Gladys to that many people if I have to talk to each person live, so I have to **double** myself.

In my opinion, offering this training course is the best way of offering my home automation knowledge to thousands of potential users in a single, lively, practical medium.

On a more personal note, having this "base", with an office that I'll be able to equip to do YouTube livestreams, is a huge comfort for me. I'll be able to develop this distribution channel even further!

## Conclusion

Thank you to all those who have followed this launch and who will follow me in this new project.

Every contribution you make by purchasing this training course is a support that will enable Gladys to develop even further.

I can't wait to show you all this!
