Hi everyone!

Today I'm launching a new release, Gladys Assistant v4.9.

In this version, I'm bringing a new major integration to Gladys: Amazon Alexa.

It means we are now compatible with all voice assistant: [Google Home](/docs/integrations/google-home) and [Amazon Alexa](/docs/integrations/alexa).

## What's new in Gladys Assistant 4.9?

### Amazon Alexa integration

It's now possible to control your Gladys devices in Amazon Alexa.

We supports 3 types of control for now:

- On/Off (On lights, and switches)
- Light Brightness
- Light color

It means you can say:

- "Alexa, Turn on the light in the living room."
- "Alexa, dim the bathroom light."

To configure Amazon Alexa, it's just a few clicks.

You can follow our documentation on [how to configure Amazon Alexa](/docs/integrations/alexa).

### Inject variables in the HTTP Request action in scenes

You can now inject any variables from a scene in the HTTP Request action.

It's super simple and it can help you build powerful scene, like calling Node-RED with a custom parameter!

## Zigbee2Mqtt: Add support for Sonoff SNZB-01

We now support more clicks on the Sonoff SNZB-01 wireless switch.

## How to upgrade?

If you installed Gladys with the official Raspberry Pi OS image, your instance will update **automatically** in the coming hours. It can take up to 24 hours, don't panic.

If you installed Gladys with Docker, make sure you are using Watchtower. See the [documentation](/docs/installation/docker#auto-upgrade-gladys-with-watchtower).

With Watchtower, Gladys will update automatically.
